# ml_time_series_prediction

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to extract and analyze a large amount of features with noisy data, and find a small subset of features that have predictive power to stock prices.

## Importance
This research project has the following importance:
1. When using machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices, using too many features can lead to overfitting, which means that the model may perform well on the training data but will not generalize well to new data. By selecting a smaller subset of features that are highly predictive, the model can be more easily interpretable and can generalize better to new data, which is crucial for making profitable investment decisions. 
2. Using a smaller subset of features can reduce computational complexity, which can speed up the model training process and allow for more efficient use of resources.
